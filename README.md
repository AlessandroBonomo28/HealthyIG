HealthyIG is a modified version of the Instagram app that **BLOCKS** all the toxic Instagram features like
* reels
* home page
* reel chaining
* explore section

HealthyIG prevents doom-scrolling and **ALLOWS** you to use all of the other Instagram features, like
* view your friend's stories
* navigate to profiles via the search bar
* view profiles
* text your friends
* view the reels that your friend sends you

The app is safe. I installed the base Instagram app from **APKMirror**, decompiled it, removed the endpoints for reel fetching, and recompiled it. If you don't trust my `install.apk`, you can build it yourself with the instructions in this repository.

## Requirements
Requires **Linux** with the following tools:

* [apktool](https://apktool.org/docs/install/)
* zipalign (`sudo apt install zipalign -y`)
* apksigner (`sudo apt install apksigner -y`)

- `install.apk` is a patched version of the Instagram app
- `ig.apk` is the copy of `com.instagram.android_version...apk`

I found `com.instagram.android_version...apk` on APKMirror. As an alternative, you can extract it from your phone.

## Build your own APK
### Obtain the Instagram APK
You can download the Instagram APK from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/instagram-instagram-300-0-0-29-110-release/). Alternatively, you can follow these steps to download the obtain the APK from your phone directly:
* Open the Settings app.
* Open the menu `About phone`.
* Click on `Build number` until you get developer option.
* Return to the main menu of the Settings app, and open the developer options.
* Under `Debugging`, activate `USB debugging`.
* Install the Android Debug Bridge on your Linux machine (e.g. `sudo apt-get install adb` on Ubuntu).
* Connect your Android device with your Linux machine.
* Allow USB debugging on your Android device.
* Obtain the path of the Instagram APK by running `adb shell pm path com.instagram.android`.
* Finally, pull the APK by running `adb pull <path>`.

### Run the patch script
```bash
# copy/rename it to ig.apk
sudo cp com.instagram.android_version...apk ig.apk

# decompile the apk
apktool d -r -f -o ig_plain ig.apk
```

**Note:** always check after you run `script.sh` that the script doesn't corrupt itself, replacing its own '//' characters

```bash
# break the endpoints with script.sh
sudo chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh

# recompile the apk
apktool b -r -f ig_plain

sudo cp ig_plain/dist/ig.apk patched.apk

# optimize with zipalign
zipalign -v 4 patched.apk install.apk

# generate keypair (insert password 'foobar', the keygen step is required only the first time)
keytool -genkeypair -alias key0 -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000 -keystore patched_instagram_key.jks

# sign the apk with 'foobar' as password
echo foobar | apksigner sign --ks ./patched_instagram_key.jks --v1-signing-enabled true --v2-signing-enabled true --v3-signing-enabled false install.apk
```
- Now **uninstall the Instagram app**.
- Copy `install.apk` to your phone, and install it.
